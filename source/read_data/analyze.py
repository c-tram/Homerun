#purpose of this file will be to analyze the data that we have gathered from the gather_data folder and to create visualizations of the data
#we will use pandas to read the data and matplotlib to create visualizations
#from this data, we will be able to see trends and patterns in the data that we have gathered and predict who should have won the WS based on the data and overall percentages for each tim to have won the world series
